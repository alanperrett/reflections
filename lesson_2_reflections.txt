What happens when you initialise a repository, why do you need to do it?

Git creates a .git folder in the location that you initialise. No files are tracked or included in a commit at this stage.

You need to do this to tell Git that this is where it needs to track the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area allows you to assemble the files that ae going to be tracked to make a logical commit. The value is that otherwise multiple commits would need to be made, which may not represent a logical unit.
