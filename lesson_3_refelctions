Refelctions on lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This makes a lot of sense when working with multiple collaborators for example. Even if they don't want to add code, they can do 
code reviews, make suggestions and so on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something in you local repository that you want to roll back at some point, if ther are multiple 
commits from other users, this roll back woud lbe difficult. Equally you migth want a stable base to put trick changes into.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork describes cloning a repo on github to another location on gihub. Clone is making a copy either of a remote repo or of a 
local one to your own machine. A branch means making a new version of the code line for different changes to be made to those on 
the main or master branch for example.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
For off line working this is useful, but evan with internet access it makes sense to have a local copy to 
check merges and commits without interacting with the remote repo.
