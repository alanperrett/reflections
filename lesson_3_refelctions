Refelctions on lesson 3

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
This makes a lot of sense when working with multiple collaborators for example. Even if they don't want to add code, they can do 
code reviews, make suggestions and so on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something in you local repository that you want to roll back at some point, if ther are multiple 
commits from other users, this roll back woud lbe difficult. Equally you migth want a stable base to put trick changes into.
